        <p>
            This privacy policy is applicable to the Lightspeed Impact app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by Joonas Kollander (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".

        <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

        <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
        <p>
            The Application collects minimal information that you voluntarily provide while using it. Specifically, this includes your chosen alias and, if applicable, a name for any group you create. This information is solely used for displaying to other players within the Application and does not identify you personally. Since you have full control over the alias you choose, the data collected is minimal and should not be considered significant. We prioritize your privacy and ensure that your information is not shared with third parties without your consent, unless required by law.
        </p>

        <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
            In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically depending on user consent and applicable laws. This may include information such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system version, anonymized identifiers, approximate network-based location (such as location inferred from an IP address), and information about how the Application is used. Where required by applicable law, such information is only collected after obtaining your consent and in accordance with your consent choices.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>
            The Application uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and synchronize gameplay-related data. This data may include user-generated content such as chosen aliases, group names, and game progress. This information is stored on Google Firebase servers and is used solely to provide core game functionality. The Service Provider does not store sensitive personal information such as real names, addresses, or precise location data in the database.
        </p>

        <h2>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>
