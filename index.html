        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Lightspeed Impact is an independent game development project created by
            <strong>Joonas Kollander</strong> and <strong>Emilia Kollander</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a small team consisting of a professional software developer and a UX designer.
            This project is the result of a multi-year development effort focused on building
            a high-quality game for the Android ecosystem with all the skill we have to offer.

        <h2>Ongoing development</h2>
        <p>
            All planned features for version 1.0 have been implemented, and we are currently
            preparing the game for wider testing, including evaluation of its ranked ladder
            functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your interest. We look forward to welcoming players once the game
            becomes publicly available.
